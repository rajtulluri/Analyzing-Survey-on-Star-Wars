# Analyzing-Survey-on-Star-Wars

Star Wars is the epic space-opera media frnachise. It quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. There have been a total of 9 movies called episodes since its first release in 1977. While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that "The Empire Strikes Back" is clearly the best of the bunch? They surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses.

The aim of this project is to clean and analyze this survey to answer the following questions :-

How many respondants like the Star Wars franchise?
Which Star Wars film is most popular among the fans?
How many of the respondants are Super fans?
How many of the respondants like space-opera media franchises (Star Wars and Star Trek)?
Which Characters are favorable and unfavorable to the fans?
Which character is controversial, split between likes and dislikes?
